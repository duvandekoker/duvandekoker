### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Duvan de Koker, as a seasoned design professional I have developed a {deep understanding} of the {customer experience}. I draw from a wealth of knowledge and methodologies in user experience, interaction design, and user interface design to {create intuitive and immersive digital experiences}. This, coupled with a strong empathy for customers and an unwillingness to compromise on user-centered design, enables me to address both business goals and user needs.

My hands-on {technical knowledge} enables me to work across teams to share architecture, evolve design standards, introduce lean workflows, mentor peers, and drive change through collaboration ðŸ¤“.

In addition to my professional and technical competencies I attach particular importance to autonomous and self-managed work. I value proactive and clear communication within the team so that all parties involved can work successfully and efficiently. _{Youâ€™re a self-driven, adaptable and bold individuals who thrive on the freedom and trust to do the work they love in the way they like.}_

### Principles
_add a link to airtable principles_

- **Design for everyone** - Be accessible to the broadest possible audience. Design should be usable on all devices by all of the people in all situations. Design is simple, touch friendly and clear and aims for AA accessibility.
- **Design for simplicity** - Create user interfaces that promote clarity and visual simplicity.
- **Design with compassion** - Put people at the heart of everything you do. Design things that understand and respect peopleâ€™s needs. Take the time to learn about the whole person - their emotional, physical and technical needs.

### How I work
- **Design systems:** You have experience with using design systems, integrating existing patterns or components into a workflow.
- **Documentation:** Youâ€™re able to think and create with a patterns and systems mindset, and keen to share that thinking with others via documentation, usage and discussion.
- **Frameworks:** A particular framework isn't as important as the concepts underpinning all the frameworks. You can demonstrate an eagerness to learn the right framework for a particular project. If you believe that server-side rendering is a must-have rather than a nice-to-have, we're definitely on the same page.

#### Edits for myself - my values
- Youâ€™re happy to jump in feet-first, trialling new ideas and approaches with a growth mindset. If you donâ€™t get things right the first time, youâ€™re resilient, and progressive about learning and adapting for the next time around. You can manage your own time and are flexible; you recognise that each project is different and unique in its own right.
- You understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. You enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues, but youâ€™re also hands-on enough to help bring those ideas into reality.
- You understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. You prefer discussion over emails and documents. You pride yourself on expressing your ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from your colleagues and clients, whether thatâ€™s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative prototype or selecting the right framework for a project.
- You do your best work collaborating within crossâ€“functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. You instinctively share your ideas with colleagues and peers, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.
- You know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. You understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies (such as Lean or Agile), while not following any practice unthinkingly.
