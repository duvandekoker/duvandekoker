### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Duvan de Koker, as a seasoned design professional I have developed a {deep understanding} of the {customer experience}. I draw from a wealth of knowledge and methodologies in user experience, interaction design, and user interface design to {create intuitive and immersive digital experiences}. This, coupled with a strong empathy for customers and an unwillingness to compromise on user-centered design, enables me to address both business goals and user needs.

My hands-on {technical knowledge} enables me to work across teams to share architecture, evolve design standards, introduce lean workflows, mentor peers, and drive change through collaboration ðŸ¤“.

In addition to my professional and technical competencies I attach particular importance to autonomous and self-managed work. I value proactive and clear communication within the team so that all parties involved can work successfully and efficiently.

### Principles
_add a link to airtable principles_
- **Design for everyone** - Be accessible to the broadest possible audience. Design should be usable on all devices by all of the people in all situations. Design is simple, touch friendly and clear and aims for AA accessibility.
- **Design for simplicity** - Create user interfaces that promote clarity and visual simplicity.
- **Design with compassion** - Put people at the heart of everything you do. Design things that understand and respect peopleâ€™s needs. Take the time to learn about the whole person - their emotional, physical and technical needs.

### How I work
I provide evidence-based design guidance by assessing and validating specific design concepts and solutions with end-users, peers and client stakeholders.
