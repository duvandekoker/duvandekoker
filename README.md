### Hi there, my name is Duvan de Koker ðŸ‘‹

As a seasoned design professional I have developed a deep understanding of the customer experience. I draw from a wealth of knowledge and methodologies in user experience, interaction design, and user interface design to create intuitive and immersive digital experiences. This, coupled with a strong empathy for customers and an unwillingness to compromise on user-centered design, enables me to address both business goals and user needs.

My hands-on technical knowledge enables me to work across teams to share architecture, evolve design standards, introduce lean workflows, mentor peers, and drive change through collaboration ðŸ¤“.


#### Get to know me - my values

I understand common user behaviours, and can provide evidence-based design guidance by assessing and validating specific design concepts and solutions with end-users, peers and client stakeholders.

Iâ€™m happy to jump in feet-first, trialling new ideas and approaches with a growth mindset. If I donâ€™t get things right the first time, Iâ€™m resilient, and progressive about learning and adapting for the next time around. I can manage my own time and am flexible; I recognise that each project is different and unique in its own right.

I insist on a deeper understanding of the problem before rushing into solutions, even if that sometimes means starting out with â€˜just enoughâ€™. I focus on the needs of the people using the products and services I'm developing or prototyping, but am also able to understand the complexity involved in balancing them with the clientâ€™s organisational goals or technical constraints.

I understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. I enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues, but I'm also hands-on enough to help bring those ideas into reality.

I understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. I prefer discussion over emails and documents. I pride myself on expressing my ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from my colleagues and clients, whether thatâ€™s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative prototype or selecting the right framework for a project.

I do my best work collaborating within crossâ€“functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. I instinctively share my ideas with colleagues and peers, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.

I know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. I understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies, while not following any practice dogmatically. I have an array of techniques to draw upon, but focus on the outcomes of my work, rather than fetishise the way it looks or how itâ€™s delivered.


### Principles

* We learn from failure - We encourage failure, embrace setbacks, and allow mistakes. We learn, iterate and grow from them.
* We are obvious - The experiences we craft are obvious, transparent and inevitable. We go the extra mile to make the experience feel predictably inevitable.
* We make it accessible and inclusive - Everything we build should be accessible, responsive and inclusive. We sacrifice elegance over inclusiveness, readability and legibility.

Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.
